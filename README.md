# ðŸ¦‰ Bubo Reader (Fork)

[![screenshot](./demo.png)](https://reader.lunalux.io)

This is a **personal** fork of [Kevinfiol's](https://github.com/kevinfiol/rss-reader) fork of the excellent [Bubo Reader](https://github.com/georgemandis/bubo-rss) by George Mandis. 

The code, and the [deployment](https://reader.lunalux.io) are both available, but this is not intended to be useful to you. Sorry. 

I intend to adapt the repository to fit my needs. If you want to host your own, you're probably better off forking one of the original repositories.

Some of the changes I have made
- `All articles` exclude articles from feeds. 
- Import my safari bookmarks as a feeds. 
- Add hostname to more articles. 

## How to build

Node `>=22.x` required.

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

## How to host on Github Pages

1. Fork this repo!
2. Enable [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for your repo (either as a project site, or user site)
3. Configure `.github/workflows/build.yml` to your liking
    * Uncomment the `schedule` section to enable scheduled builds
